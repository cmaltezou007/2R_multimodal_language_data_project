note think going society moment possible untangle racial biases ai without society individuals becoming anti racist point would like flag equality success twitter page good starting resource individuals wanting become anti racist lots good resources found internet sure already come across causes ai bias covered already going different examples wanted put together one place go one one first incomplete skewed training set demographic categories missing models fail scale properly example bride problem example comes website called imagenet actually research cropped quite lot imagenet website contains 14 million labelled images actually 45 usa lead biased outcomes example photograph like bride left wearing white dress labelled bride north indian woman wearing wedding sari lehenga labelled performance art rather bride leads us second point labels used training cause ai bias ai known supervised machine learning means data labelled teach model behave circumstances humans create labels people discussed earlier frequently exhibit biases consciously unconsciously second reason ai bias third touched much features modelling techniques example measurements used inputs machine learning actual model introduce bias two examples first text speech speech text technology example closed captioning technologies tend perform poorly speakers women compared men way speech analysed

gendered pronouns language like english use gendered pronouns default google translate use said rather pronoun like said said phrase said occurs commonly internet others firstly reflects faulty algorithm selects used pronoun rather method also demonstrates data based bias looking frequency phrases internet leave doom gloom obviously lots ways address bias ai different levels people different

While it acknowledges that using the term 'artificial intelligence' in product descriptions can reduce purchase intentions and trigger negative responses, especially for high-risk products, it also highlights the importance of delivering value and fulfilling tasks. The discussion touches upon both the hype and potential fatigue associated with AI, as well as the need to build trust through UX and transparency. The overall sentiment is therefore neutral, reflecting a balanced consideration of the positive and negative aspects of AI's trustworthiness in public discourse."
