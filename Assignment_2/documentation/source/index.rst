The code provided here is designed to:

* **Preprocess** the CSV data relating to extracted acoustic features and speaker demographics.
* **Classify** speech based on its intent (trustworthy vs. neutral).
* **Validate** the dataset's effectiveness in categorising speech according to speaker intent and demographics.
* **Visualise** the relationship between speaker demographics, acoustic features and trustworthy intent classifications.

For detailed instructions on how to set up the environment, run the analysis scripts, and interpret the results,
refer to the **Getting Started** section.
